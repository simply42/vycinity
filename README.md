# VyCinity

Backend for configuring VyOS' routers using a central, semantic REST interface. The state of this project is currently alpha, do not use this in production!

## How to use this and how development is done

This is a [Django App](https://www.djangoproject.com/). You need to add this to a Django-project to make use of this software. Currently this App is in a so early stage, there are no packages. This is planned when the whole app is more mature. You can try it out but the produced API is still not stable until annouced here. 

For a list of unmodified dependencies visit [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). Install them using `python3 -m pip install` or similar.
